 <h2>What you'll Need to Play</h2>[m
 [m
 <p>To play Lightspeed you need a computer running Windows.  The game features an on-screen keyboard or you can play using a real keyboard with MIDI.  This requires some way to plug your MIDI keyboard into your computer.  Lots of newer keyboards these days can connect directly to a computer via USB - if yours doesn't, you can use <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=usb+midi&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=usb+midi">one of these USB to MIDI cables.</a></p>[m

[32m+[m[32m<p>If you're a music student or teacher, you're familiar with learning to sight read and how tough it is. I found that when I worked on new repertoire I only spent a certain amount of time reading - then the material was memorized and I was working more on articulation and performance. There are sight reading exercise books out there but I wanted something fun that would give me feedback for incorrect notes.</p>[m
[32m+[m
[32m+[m[32m<p>Lightspeed will not help develop your ability to read ahead of your hands, since only one note or note combination is displayed at a time. But it is a hardcore drill on note recognition, shape recognition and keyboard geography (assuming you don't look down), and by incorporating a few rounds every morning into my practice routine I've really improved my sight reading. I hope it helps you too.</p>[m
